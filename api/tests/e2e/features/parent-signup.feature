# @wip Deferred until test token strategy is implemented for /api/v1/me
# Parent Profile Auto-Creation (Policy 04) tests are temporarily disabled.
# They require a test ID token or a dev-only token bypass in verifyIdToken().
# We will re-enable these scenarios once the test harness can provide a valid token.
