# Student-Class Enrollment Implementation

**Date**: December 13, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Phase 1 & 2 Complete (View Roster + Bulk Assignment)

---

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of student-class enrollment functionality, allowing admins to assign students to classes and manage class rosters.

---

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Admin - Class Roster View (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: View all students assigned to a class

**API Endpoints Created**:
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/admin/classes/{id}/students` - Get class roster

**Backend Changes**:
- ✅ Created `/api/src/app/v1/admin/classes/[id]/students/route.ts` (GET handler)
- ✅ Added `getStudentsByClassId()` to `firestoreStudents.ts`
- ✅ Queries students by `classId` with active/admitted status filter
- ✅ Returns class details + enrolled students list

**UI Changes**:
- ✅ Created `/ui/src/app/admin/classes/[id]/roster/page.tsx`
- ✅ Added "View Roster" button on class edit page
- ✅ Displays student list with name, grade, status, parent email
- ✅ Shows capacity vs enrolled count
- ✅ Links to student detail pages
- ✅ Added `adminGetClassRoster()` to `class-api.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ Responsive table layout for roster
- ✅ Student status badges (active, admitted, etc.)
- ✅ Capacity tracking (X / Y students, Z spots available)
- ✅ Empty state when no students enrolled
- ✅ Loading skeleton
- ✅ Error handling

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Admin - Bulk Student Assignment (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Assign multiple students to a class at once

**API Endpoints Created**:
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/admin/classes/{id}/students` - Bulk assign students
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/admin/classes/{id}/students/{studentId}` - Remove student from class

**Backend Changes**:
- ✅ Added POST handler to `/api/src/app/v1/admin/classes/[id]/students/route.ts`
- ✅ Created `/api/src/app/v1/admin/classes/[id]/students/[studentId]/route.ts` (DELETE handler)
- ✅ Added `bulkAssignStudentsToClass()` to `firestoreStudents.ts`
- ✅ Added `removeStudentFromClass()` to `firestoreStudents.ts`
- ✅ Uses Firestore batch writes for atomicity
- ✅ Validates student status (must be admitted or active)
- ✅ Validates class capacity
- ✅ Validates class is active
- ✅ Changes student status from `admitted` → `active` on assignment
- ✅ Changes student status from `active` → `admitted` on removal
- ✅ Updates denormalized `enrolled` count on class

**Business Logic**:
1. Bulk Assign:
   - ✅ Validates each student exists and has valid status
   - ✅ Checks total capacity not exceeded
   - ✅ Updates student documents (classId, className, status)
   - ✅ Increments class enrolled count
   - ✅ All operations in single batch (atomic)

2. Remove:
   - ✅ Verifies student is in the class
   - ✅ Clears classId and className
   - ✅ Reverts status to `admitted` if was `active`
   - ✅ Decrements class enrolled count

**UI Changes**:
- ✅ "Remove" button for each student in roster
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before removal
- ✅ Loading state during removal
- ✅ Auto-refresh roster after removal
- ✅ Added `adminBulkAssignStudents()` to `class-api.ts`
- ✅ Added `adminRemoveStudentFromClass()` to `class-api.ts`
- ✅ "Assign Students" button placeholder (alerts coming soon)

**Features**:
- ✅ Remove student from class with confirmation
- ✅ Disabled state during removal operation
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Capacity validation prevents over-enrollment
- ✅ "Assign Students" button disabled when class is full

## Files Created

### API Files
```
api/src/app/v1/admin/classes/[id]/students/route.ts            (GET, POST handlers)
api/src/app/v1/admin/classes/[id]/students/[studentId]/route.ts (DELETE handler)
```

### UI Files
```
ui/src/app/admin/classes/[id]/roster/page.tsx                  (Roster view page)
```

---

## Files Modified

### API
```
api/src/lib/firestoreStudents.ts
  + getStudentsByClassId()
  + bulkAssignStudentsToClass()
  + removeStudentFromClass()
```

### UI
```
ui/src/lib/class-api.ts
  + RosterStudent interface
  + adminGetClassRoster()
  + adminBulkAssignStudents()
  + adminRemoveStudentFromClass()

ui/src/app/admin/classes/[id]/edit/page.tsx
  + Added "View Roster" button in header
```

---

## Data Flow

### View Roster
```
1. User clicks "View Roster" on class edit page
2. UI fetches: GET /api/v1/admin/classes/{id}/students
3. API validates admin role
4. API queries class by ID
5. API queries students where classId == {id}
6. API returns class details + student list
7. UI displays roster table
```

### Remove Student from Class
```
1. User clicks "Remove" on student row
2. Confirmation dialog shown
3. UI calls: DELETE /api/v1/admin/classes/{id}/students/{studentId}
4. API validates admin role
5. API verifies student is in this class
6. API batch update:
   - Student: classId=null, className=null, status='admitted'
   - Class: enrolled -= 1
7. UI refreshes roster
```

### Bulk Assign Students (API ready, UI coming in Phase 2.1)
```
1. User selects multiple students
2. UI calls: POST /api/v1/admin/classes/{id}/students
   Body: { studentIds: ["id1", "id2", "id3"] }
3. API validates admin role
4. API checks class capacity
5. API validates each student (exists, admitted/active status)
6. API batch update:
   - Each student: classId={id}, className={name}, status='active'
   - Class: enrolled += studentIds.length
7. API returns updated roster
8. UI shows success message
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Denormalization Strategy
- Students store `classId` and `className` (denormalized)
- Classes store `enrolled` count (denormalized)
- No `studentIds` array in class (uses reverse query)

**Why?**
- Faster queries (query students by classId directly)
- Simpler class capacity checks (just compare enrolled vs capacity)
- Avoids large array operations in Firestore

### Batch Operations
- Use Firestore batch writes for multi-document updates
- Ensures atomicity (all updates succeed or all fail)
- Updates student + class in single transaction

### Status Workflow
```
Student Status: pending → admitted → active → inactive/withdrawn
                                      ↑    ↓
                               Assign | Remove
                                Class | Class
```

- [ ] Add "Unassigned" tab on admin students page
- [ ] Show count of unassigned students
- [ ] "Quick Assign" action button per student

---

## Security & Validation

### API Authorization
- ✅ All endpoints require `admin` role
- ✅ Firebase ID token verification
- ✅ User status must be `active`

### Input Validation
- ✅ Zod schemas for request body validation
- ✅ Student IDs validated (non-empty strings)
- ✅ Class ID validated (exists, active status)
- ✅ Capacity checks prevent over-enrollment

### Business Rules Enforced
- ✅ Can only assign admitted or active students
- ✅ Cannot assign to inactive classes
- ✅ Cannot exceed class capacity
- ✅ Cannot remove student not in class
- ✅ Status transitions follow workflow

---

## Performance Considerations

### Firestore Indexes Required
```
Collection: students
Fields: classId (Ascending), status (Ascending), lastName (Ascending), firstName (Ascending)
```

### Query Optimization
- Compound index on `classId + status` for roster queries
- Additional ordering by `lastName, firstName` for sorted results
- Firestore auto-creates single-field indexes

### Caching Strategy
- Client-side caching not needed (roster changes infrequently)
- Real-time listeners could be added later for live updates
- Batch operations minimize Firestore write costs

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update `docs/ROLES.md` - Mark roster features as complete
- [ ] Update `docs/FEATURES.md` - Add student-class enrollment section
- [ ] Update `docs/FIRESTORE-COLLECTIONS.md` - Document roster queries
- [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints

- [x] Status transitions work (active ↔ admitted)
- [x] API for bulk assignment ready
- [x] Capacity limits enforced
- [x] Tests pass for all new functionality

✅ **Phase 2.1 Complete**:
- [x] Admin can bulk assign students to class (UI)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Denormalization is powerful**: Storing `className` and `enrolled` count makes queries much simpler
2. **Batch writes are essential**: Ensures data consistency across multiple documents
3. **Status workflow matters**: Clear transitions between pending → admitted → active → inactive
4. **Mobile-first**: Responsive table design required from the start
5. **Incremental delivery**: Phase 1 (view) → Phase 2 (remove) → Phase 2.1 (assign) allows testing each piece
6. **In-memory filtering**: Firestore doesn't support querying for null/missing fields, so `unassigned` filter done in memory
