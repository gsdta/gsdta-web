# Home Page Plan (Milestone 1)

Objective: Design and implement a simple, fast, and public home page that showcases GSDTA with a Thirukkural hero, clear public navigation, key stats tiles, and a bottom carousel. All items must be accessible without login.

Scope for this milestone (what we will ship)
- Public navigation (visible to non-logged-in users): Home, About us, Register, Team, Documents, Calendar, Text books, Donate, Contact Us.
- Hero section: Thirukkural card with Thiruvalluvar image (clicking the image returns to Home).
- Stats tiles (horizontal row):
  - 200 students and growing
  - 45 teachers
  - 200+ years of cumulative experience in running school
  - 25+ non-teaching volunteers
- Bottom carousel: slides for cultural events, community support, etc.
- Mobile-first responsive layout, accessible and performant.

Out of scope for this milestone
- RBAC, authentication flows, or private content.
- Live stats from backend (use static values now; keep types ready for later).
- CMS/complex editing. Use static TS/JSON.

Information architecture and routes
- /                   → Home (this page)
- /about              → About us
- /register           → Register
- /team               → Team
- /documents          → Documents (public)
- /calendar           → Calendar
- /textbooks          → Text books
- /donate             → Donate
- /contact            → Contact Us

Notes
- All routes must be accessible to non-logged-in users.
- If a page is not implemented, add a minimal stub page with heading + "Coming soon" copy (avoid dead links).

Repo alignment (what exists vs. what we’ll change)
- Existing home composition is in `src/components/HomeContent.tsx` and currently includes multiple sections: About, Programs, Highlights, Faculty, Events, Testimonials, CTA.
  - We will simplify this to only: Hero (new `HeroThirukkural`), `home/StatTiles`, and `home/HomeCarousel`.
  - We will remove (for now) the other sections from the homepage: About, Programs, Highlights, Faculty, Events, Testimonials, CTA.
- Components already present and to be reused:
  - `src/components/ThirukkuralDisplay.tsx` (for rendering a Kural within the hero)
  - `src/components/home/StatTiles.tsx` (already renders horizontal tiles; uses `src/data/home.ts`)
  - `src/components/home/HomeCarousel.tsx` (scroll-snap carousel with controls; uses `src/data/home.ts`)
- Navigation: we will update `src/components/Header.tsx` to show the public menu for anonymous users as specified, while keeping logged-in behavior intact.
  - Brand/logo ("GSDTA") already links to `/`.
  - We’ll also make the Thiruvalluvar image in the hero clickable to `/`.

UI composition (final structure)
- Header (sticky)
  - Left: brand/logo (click → /)
  - Right: public menu items (always visible for non-logged-in): Home, About us, Register, Team, Documents, Calendar, Text books, Donate, Contact Us
- HeroThirukkural (new component)
  - Thiruvalluvar image (from `public/thiruvalluvar.svg`), wrapped in a link to `/`
  - A Kural rendered via `ThirukkuralDisplay` (Tamil required; English optional if available)
- StatTiles
  - Four tiles; on mobile: horizontally scrollable with scroll-snap; on desktop: 4-column grid
- HomeCarousel
  - 4+ slides: Cultural events, Community support, STEM workshops, Field trips
- Footer (minimal)

Data and content sourcing
- `src/data/home.ts` (already exists)
  - Stats (static):
    - 200 students and growing
    - 45 teachers
    - 200+ years of cumulative experience in running school
    - 25+ non-teaching volunteers
  - Slides (static): cultural/community/STEM/field trips (images under `public/images/...`)
- Thirukkural
  - Use existing `ThirukkuralDisplay` for client-side rotation.
  - Future: support server-provided daily/random Kural via `/v1/public/thirukkural`.

Accessibility (A11y)
- Proper heading hierarchy: h1 for page title (hero), h2 for each section
- Visible focus states; `aria-current` for active menu item; keyboard navigable nav
- Hero image alt text; link labelled for screen readers
- Carousel: buttons with aria-labels; `aria-roledescription="carousel"`; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

Performance and SEO
- Use Next/Image for hero/carousel graphics
- Keep hero lightweight; lazy-load carousel below the fold
- Add a sensible meta title/description for home; OG/Twitter tags in a later pass

Testing plan
- Unit (Jest/RTL)
  - Public nav renders all specified menu items for anonymous users
  - Hero shows a Kural; Thiruvalluvar image links to `/`
  - StatTiles render 4 expected cards
- E2E (Playwright)
  - Non-logged-in user sees all menu items
  - Clicking Thiruvalluvar navigates to `/`
  - Carousel visible; can navigate slides via keyboard
  - Mobile: tiles horizontally scrollable

Implementation checklist (tailored to this repo)
- Create `src/components/home/HeroThirukkural.tsx` (wrap image in `<Link href="/">` and render `ThirukkuralDisplay`)
- Update `src/components/HomeContent.tsx` to only render:
  - `<HeroThirukkural />`
  - `<StatTiles />`
  - `<HomeCarousel />`
- Update `src/components/Header.tsx` anonymous state to show public menu items exactly as requested
- Ensure `src/data/home.ts` text matches copy above (already aligned)
- Add route stubs under `src/app` if missing: `/about`, `/register`, `/team`, `/documents`, `/calendar`, `/textbooks`, `/donate`, `/contact`
  - Each with minimal content so links work

Success criteria (Definition of Done)
- All specified menu items visible and navigable without login
- Hero renders a Kural and the Thiruvalluvar image links to Home
- Four stats tiles visible, responsive on mobile/desktop
- Carousel renders with at least 4 slides and keyboard-accessible controls
- No console errors; basic a11y checks pass locally

Future hooks
- Wire stats to `/v1/public/stats`
- Daily/random Kural from backend
- Expand carousel items and link to detail pages
- RBAC and authenticated flows in subsequent milestones
