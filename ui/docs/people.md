      As a proud Tamilan and a member of the vibrant San Diego Tamil community
      for over 10 years, if I had to choose one attribute that I value most in
      myself, it would be that I am a community builder. To me, the foundation
      of any strong community lies in fostering deep connections and creating a
      sense of belonging for all. Communities are the building blocks of great
      civilizations and cultures. They evolve and thrive through the collective
      efforts of individuals who come together with shared values. This is
      celebrated in Tamil literature, which highlights the importance of
      community in shaping societies, from ancient times to the present day. No
      better place to begin this than the place of "learning". By working
      together to build a supportive and inclusive environment, we are not only
      strengthening our own community but also providing a legacy for future
      generations. When done right, the impact of our actions will be felt with
      our children and grandchildren learning from our example, without needing
      to be taught. None of this would be possible without each one of you.
      Together, we build something lasting, something meaningful. I am always
      honored to play my small part in this process. After all, it’s all about
      the "Spirit of the Squirrel"—doing "Worthwhile Work."

      I am a finance professional with extensive experience in the industry.
      For the past 20 years, I have been actively involved in the San Diego
      Tamil community, contributing to various cultural, educational, and social
      initiatives. I am deeply passionate about preserving and promoting the
      Tamil language, particularly by teaching it to the next generation. My
      goal is to instill a strong linguistic and cultural foundation in young
      learners, ensuring that they stay connected to their Tamil heritage while
      thriving in a multicultural environment.

    bio: >-
      I, Devi Kumaradev, one of the board members of GSDTA, have been serving
      this Tamil community for over a decade. I started to teach Tamil as
      Assistant Teacher and got interest to teach almost all grade levels.
      Basically, I want to be a teacher but somehow got pushed into corporate
      world, but teaching in Tamil school quenched the thirst of being a
      teacher. I really enjoy teaching very small children as creating a passion
      for them to learn the language was an awesome experience. I also started
      to co-ordinate for Tamil Theni and Kural Theni. Training our school
      children to take part on those National level competition was so rewarding
      despite the hours of work it takes to prepare them. I wish good health and
      happy life to everyone around me!!!
