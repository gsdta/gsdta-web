      "bio": "As a proud Tamilan and a member of the vibrant San Diego Tamil community for over 10 years, if I had to choose one attribute that I value most in myself, it would be that I am a community builder. To me, the foundation of any strong community lies in fostering deep connections and creating a sense of belonging for all. Communities are the building blocks of great civilizations and cultures. They evolve and thrive through the collective efforts of individuals who come together with shared values. This is celebrated in Tamil literature, which highlights the importance of community in shaping societies, from ancient times to the present day. No better place to begin this than the place of \"learning\". By working together to build a supportive and inclusive environment, we are not only strengthening our own community but also providing a legacy for future generations. When done right, the impact of our actions will be felt with our children and grandchildren learning from our example, without needing to be taught. None of this would be possible without each one of you. Together, we build something lasting, something meaningful. I am always honored to play my small part in this process. After all, it's all about the \"Spirit of the Squirrel\"—doing \"Worthwhile Work.\""

      "bio": "I, Devi Kumaradev, one of the board members of GSDTA, have been serving this Tamil community for over a decade. I started to teach Tamil as Assistant Teacher and got interest to teach almost all grade levels. Basically, I want to be a teacher but somehow got pushed into corporate world, but teaching in Tamil school quenched the thirst of being a teacher. I really enjoy teaching very small children as creating a passion for them to learn the language was an awesome experience. I also started to co-ordinate for Tamil Theni and Kural Theni. Training our school children to take part on those National level competition was so rewarding despite the hours of work it takes to prepare them. I wish good health and happy life to everyone around me!!!"
